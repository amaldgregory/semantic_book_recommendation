# Semantic Book Recommender

An AI-powered semantic book recommendation tool that suggests books based on a combination of natural language queries, broad category filters, and emotional tone preferences.

Built using sentence-transformer embeddings and vector similarity search, this project takes your description of the kind of story you're in the mood for and returns the most relevant book recommendations from a curated dataset of 7,000+ books.
